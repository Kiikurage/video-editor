**This software is under development**

## Key Concepts

- **Easy-to-Use**
    - You can use Power-point like editor to create what you imagine.
- **High Customizability**
    - Other video authoring software has many useful features, but not everything is needed to create your video.
    - This application is based on many extensions. You can plug-in/out features based on your demand, and create simple, your-own UI!
- **Multi-Platform Support**
    - Windows, macOS, and Linux are supported!
